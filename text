            What makes Ashirwad Games different is our proprietary ranking algorithm which analyzes all of your Game stats to sort your team into a division. This means you will only be competing against teams of a similar skill level.

            Playing in tournaments can feel hopeless when you know that you’re competing against streamers and pros. The truth is, not everyone gets paid to play games ; And some people are just straight up better than you. But that doesn’t mean you can’t have some healthy competition and even make some cash while you’re at it.
